# Custom Providers

<Callout>
  The AI SDK Language Model Specification is experimental. It may change in the
  future without a major version bump.
</Callout>

The AI SDK provides a language model specification.
You can write your own providers that adhere to the AI SDK language model specification and they will be compatible with the AI Core functions.

You can find the Language Model Specification in the [AI SDK repository](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider/src/language-model/v1).
It can be imported from `'@ai-sdk/provider'`.

We also provide utilities that make it easier to implement a custom provider. You can find them in the `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` package ([source code](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider-utils)).

There are several reference implementations, e.g. a [OpenAI reference implementation](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/openai)
and a [Mistral reference implementation](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/mistral).

## Provider Facade

A custom provider should follow the pattern of using a provider facade with factory methods for the specific providers.
An instance of the custom provider class with default settings can be exported for convenience.

```ts filename="custom-provider-facade.ts"
import { generateId, loadApiKey } from ''@ai-sdk/provider-utils'';
import { CustomChatLanguageModel } from './custom-chat-language-model';
import { CustomChatModelId, CustomChatSettings } from './mistral-chat-settings';

/**
 * Custom provider facade.
 */
export class CustomProvider {
  readonly baseUrl?: string;
  readonly apiKey?: string;

  constructor(
    options: {
      baseUrl?: string;
      apiKey?: string;
    } = {},
  ) {
    this.baseUrl = options.baseUrl;
    this.apiKey = options.apiKey;
  }

  private get baseConfig() {
    return {
      baseUrl: this.baseUrl ?? 'https://custom.ai/v1',
      headers: () => ({
        Authorization: `Bearer ${loadApiKey({
          apiKey: this.apiKey,
          environmentVariableName: 'CUSTOM_API_KEY',
          description: 'Custom Provider',
        })}`,
      }),
    };
  }

  chat(modelId: CustomChatModelId, settings: CustomChatSettings = {}) {
    return new CustomChatLanguageModel(modelId, settings, {
      provider: 'custom.chat',
      ...this.baseConfig,
    });
  }
}

/**
 * Default custom provider instance.
 */
export const customprovider = new CustomProvider();
```

## Language Model Implementation

Please refer to the Language Model Specification in the [AI SDK repository](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider/src/language-model/v1).

We also provide utilities that make it easier to implement a custom provider. You can find them in the `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` package ([source code](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider-utils)).

There are several reference implementations, e.g. a [OpenAI reference implementation](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/openai)
and a [Mistral reference implementation](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/mistral).

### Errors

The AI SDK provides [standardized errors](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider/src/errors) that should be used by providers where possible.
This will make it easy for user to debug them.

### Retries, timeouts, and abort signals

The AI SDK will handle retries, timeouts, and aborting requests in a unified way.
The model classes should not implement retries or timeouts themselves.
Instead, they should use the abortSignal parameter to determine when the call should be aborted, and they should throw `ApiCallErrors` (or similar)
with a correct `isRetryable` flag when errors such as network errors occur.
