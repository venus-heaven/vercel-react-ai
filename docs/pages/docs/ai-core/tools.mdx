# Tools and Tool Calling

The `generateObject` and `streamObject` AI functions support tool calls for models with such a capability.
The tool call and tool results objects are typed.
Tool calling works as follows:

<Steps>
### Add tools to `generateText` or `streamText`

You define the tools and pass them into `generateText` or `streamText` using the `tools` parameter.

AI Core tools are objects that implement the `ExperimentalTool<PARAMETERS, RESULT>` interface with the following properties:

- **description**: An optional description of the tool. This information is provided to the language model and can influence when the tool is picked.
- **parameters**: A [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema that defines the parameters. It is converted to a JSON schema that is consumed by the LLM, and also used to validate the LLM tool calls.
- **execute**: An optional async function that is called with the arguments from the tool call and produces a value of type `RESULT`.

The `tools` parameter is an object that has the tool names as keys and the tools as values:

```ts {3-17}
const result = await experimental_generateText({
  model: openai.chat('gpt-3.5-turbo'),
  tools: {
    weather: {
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }: { location: string }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    },
    cityAttractions: {
      parameters: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
    },
  },
  prompt:
    'What is the weather in San Francisco and what attractions should I visit?',
});
```

### The language model generates tool calls

The language model will invoke the tools when it makes sense.
The tool calls are provided as tool call objects.
Each tool call has a `toolCallId`, a `toolName`, and a typed `args` object.

### Tools are executed

Tools which have an `execute` function are run automatically when corresponding tool calls are generated.
The results of the tool executions are provided using tool result objects.
Each tool result object has a `toolCallId`, a `toolName`, a typed `args` object, and a typed `result`.
