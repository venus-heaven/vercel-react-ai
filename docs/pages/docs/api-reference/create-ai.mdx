# createAI

## `createAI`

`createAI` is a function that creates a new `ai/rsc` instance.

## Parameters

### `AIState`

`AIState` is a JSON representation of all the context the LLM needs to read. Usually for a chat app, `AIState` contains the textual conversation history between the user and the assistant. In practice, it can also be used to store other values and meta information such as `createdAt` of each message. `AIState` by default, can be accessed/modified on both Server and Client.

### `UIState`

`UIState` is what the application uses to display the UI. It is a fully client-side state (very similar to `useState`) and can keep data and UI elements returned by the LLM. This state can be anything, but can't be accessed on the server.

## Returns

The method returns an `<AI>` instance, which is a provider component that is used to wrap a part of your component tree and pass the context value down the tree. Any component that needs the context value can access it, no matter how deep it is in the component tree.

## Example

### Server-Side Setup

<Tabs items={['Next.js (App Router)']}>
  <Tab>
    We use `createAI` to initialize an `ai/rsc` instance on the server.

    ```tsx filename="app/action.tsx" {5-11}
    import 'server-only'

    import { createAI } from "ai/rsc";

    export const AI = createAI({
      actions: {
        submitUserMessage,
      },
      initialUIState: [],
      initialAIState: [],
    });
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Client-Side Setup

<Tabs items={['Next.js (App Router)']}>
  <Tab>
    The `ai/rsc` instance is then available to the client through the `<AI/>` context provider.

    ```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" {11-13}
    import { AI } from "./action";

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }>) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <AI>
              {children}
            </AI>
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }

    export const runtime = "edge";
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
